EpubCheck
=========

EpubCheck is a tool to validate EPUB files. It can detect many
types of errors in EPUB. OCF container structure, OPF and OPS mark-up,
and internal reference consistency are checked. EpubCheck can be run
as a standalone command-line tool or used as a Java library.

Initial EpubCheck development was largely done at [Adobe Systems](http://www.adobe.com/).
